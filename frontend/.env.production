# Production Environment Configuration
# This file intentionally does NOT set VITE_API_URL
# The API client will fall back to localhost, which will fail silently in production
# This disconnects the frontend from the Railway backend

# Note: Backend-dependent features (Auth, Admin, AI Assistant) will not work
# Static pages (Donations, Events, Gallery) will continue to function
